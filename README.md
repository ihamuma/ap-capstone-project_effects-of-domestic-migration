Hello!

Thank you for making it this far into the repo. This project is going to be under fast-paced development, so please do check in quickly to keep up. But not too much or I might get performance anxiety - you know, 9/10 men etc.

But on a more serious note, this is a very experimental project. I do not make any claims on the scientific accuracy of any of the results produced by running programs in this repo, nor do I take any stance on the actual matter of migrants in Finland.
This repo is merely intended for the completion of a class project related to a subject that I found personally interesting, and related to which there were copious datasets available.
So don't come @ me, etc.

That being said, if you take a look and see something funky, let me know! I will be working solo on this one since it's, well, a school project, but happy to take in suggestions.
Just don't try to commit - my professor is already mad it me as is, so I would prefer not having to explain why someone else is contributing to my project at this time.

So yeah, cool, see you around.
